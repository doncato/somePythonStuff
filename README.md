# somePythonStuff
Some random Python scripts I made.
I don't even know whether they will work or not.
Maybe someone wants to say something about it, or get's inspired by it, I don't know

# Overview of Content:
+ calc.py - very basic calculator
+ mastermind.py - Mastermind game (Textline based)
+ name-generator.py - A runable script to generate random new names and words, which should be moderately speakable
+ duplicate_remover.py - A runable script/tool to remove all duplicate lines in a text document. **WARNING** The text file will be overwritten. You need to provide the filename/path as an argument (`python3 duplicate_remover.py text.txt`).
